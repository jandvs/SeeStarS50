* Edit/Copy a target in the list.
   Right click on the target and select Edit or Copy.  Both options will fill out the form with the target's data.
   If it was an Edit, it will replace the original target when you click Update.
   If it was a Copy, it will add the new target to the end of the list when you click Add.

* Progress bars for each target (based on session time)

* Skip current target and allow it to move on to next target

* Cancel all targets

* Save/Load target lists with custom filename, for multiple target lists.
  Default save location for target lists is your users documents folder.

* Pull RA/DEC + Object Name from Stellarium
  For this feature to work, you must enable the Remote Control plugin in Stellarium.
  Then enter the IP and port of the computer running Stellarium in the settings of this app.
  Format is IP:Port, for example:   192.168.1.100:8090
  The app will save this setting in a config file in the same folder as the app and reload it automaticaly.

* Allow to set the exposure time for each target.
  Any exposure time of 30 seconds or less should work automatically.
  For longer exposure times, it is vitally important that you first do a 30 second exposure capture using
  the seestar app, so that it will have the darkframes for exposure length.
  Then this app will trick the seestar into thinking it's going to do 30 second exposures, but it will
  actually do the longer exposure time you set here.
  I've gotten it to do a 1500 second exposure during my tests.
  No point in doing this if not mounted in EQ-Mode, as the stars will trail.



================================================================================================
Initial version
================================================================================================
  .Net8 GUI app to do schdule planning and control of SeeStar.
  Ability to pull RA/Dec from SeeStar.
  Ability to do mosaic targets.

Future TODO
================================================================================================

Generate Script (Hopefully cross platform)

Connect to multiple SeeStars
   synced or independent?

Target list to include a Time to Start
  Start Time can be ASAP and ordered by the order it was added, set time take precedence.
  If there is overlap conflict, the later target start after the earlier one finishes.
  List auto sorts by start time.

Session Time can be ALAN, meaning you must end it manually.
  Not sure if the SeeStar reports back total integration time on a target, maybe there can be a trigger for that.

Target to specify which SeeStar to use, when connected to multiple

If target is mosaic, then specify different SeeStars to handle tiles?
   or maybe if you want a mosaic, it splits it out into seperate targets for the tiles and each can then be assigned to a SeeStar?

Target to include sub exposure time (5s, 10s 15s, 20s, 30s, 1m, 2, 3m, 5m, 8m, 13m, 21m, 34m)

Search for Target by name, either via Stellarium or possible include object libraries in the app. Probably stellarium first.
